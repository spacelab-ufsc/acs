\chapter{Objective} \label{ch:objective}

\paragraph{}
\indent 
The objective of this document is to describe the components of a simulation model for a nanosatellite's passive attitude control system, derive the related equations and provide a software architecture for the integration of such components. 

\indent 
A simulation of this system must capture the phenomena related to orbital motion, attitude dynamics and the interaction between the geomagnetic field and the magnetic materials used for attitude control, hence the components of such simulation are chosen to be independent models of each phenomena containing some physically motivated interface between them, allowing for the integration of the components to provide the final model.
